# Architecture

This page explains how the repository turns one canonical skill catalog into
agent-specific files for Codex, Claude, and DeepSeek.

The manifests are the source of truth:

- `manifest/skills.yaml` defines canonical skill names, descriptions,
  supported agents, dependencies, and aliases.
- `manifest/profiles.yaml` defines selectable skill bundles.
- `manifest/artifacts.yaml` defines optional templates, personas,
  instruction docs, entrypoints, and management notices.
- `manifest/dependencies.yaml` and `manifest/system-dependencies.yaml` define
  logical tools and sanitized maintainer-system dependency observations.

The installer resolves those manifests into per-agent target artifacts and
records ownership in `.ai-agents-skills/state.json` under the selected root.
Existing unmanaged files are skipped by default.

Install flow:

1. Resolve selected skills and artifacts from `--skill`, `--skills`,
   `--profile`, `--artifact`, `--artifacts`, or `--artifact-profile`.
2. Detect available agent homes under the selected `--root`.
3. Resolve the requested install mode, then apply per-agent loader
   compatibility before linking, referencing, or copying canonical skill bodies
   into each supported target format.
4. Add managed instruction blocks only for skills or artifacts that are
   installed, adopted, migrated, updated, or already managed.
5. Record hashes, source paths, install modes, and ownership metadata for
   verification, uninstall, and rollback.

Artifact classes:

| Artifact class | Current behavior |
|---|---|
| `skill-file` | Default `auto` mode links canonical `SKILL.md` where the loader supports it. Codex skill files resolve to reference adapters because Codex discovery ignores file-symlinked user skills. Explicit symlink, reference, and copy modes are available for all agents. |
| `skill-support-file` | Symlinks canonical references, scripts, assets, templates, and agent notes when the effective skill install remains symlinked; copied in copy mode; skipped in reference mode. |
| `instruction-block` | Adds or updates a managed block in `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` only when the matching skill artifact is installed, adopted, updated, or migrated. |
| `management-notice` | Optional top-level managed block explaining that this repo is the source and local agent homes are runtime targets. |
| `agent-persona` | Optional reviewer/persona files. Codex receives TOML custom agents, Claude receives Markdown subagents, and DeepSeek receives reference prompts. |
| `template` | Optional research, report, specification, and task templates. |
| `instruction-doc` | Optional workflow reference documents installed outside skill folders. |
| `entrypoint-alias` | Optional quick-action aliases. Claude receives command files; Codex and DeepSeek receive reference documents. |
| `command` | Reserved optional target class for direct command wrappers. |
| `tool-shim` | Reserved optional target class for DeepSeek or runtime helper tools. |

Codex user-level skills target `~/.codex/skills` in this setup. The optional
`.agents/skills` layout is treated as a compatibility or workspace target when
detected, not as the default global Codex target.

Safety boundary:

- auth files, API keys, provider config, session logs, downloaded libraries,
  and local runtime state are not managed by this repo
- unmanaged user files are skipped unless `--adopt`, `--backup-replace`, or
  `--migrate` is selected explicitly
- uninstall and rollback require confirmation when applied and affect only
  recorded managed artifact paths and managed marker blocks
